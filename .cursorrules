# Project Overview:

1. This is a web application that allows users to manage their reading list.
2. Users can add, remove, and update books in their reading list.
3. Users can order books by title, author, and publication date. 
4. Users can view their reading list and the books in it.
5. Users will have a profile that allows them can sign into and out of their books own personal reading list. 
6. Users can edit their profile information.
7. Users can reset their password.  
8. Security with Spring Security.

#Application Logic Design：

1. All request and response handling must be done only in RestController.
2. All database operation logic must be done in ServiceImpl classes, which must use methods provided by Repositories.
3. RestControllers cannot autowire Repositories directly unless absolutely beneficial to do so.
4. ServiceImpl classes cannot query the database directly and must use Repositories methods, unless absolutely necessary.
5. Data carrying between RestControllers and serviceImpl classes, and vice versa, must be done only using DTOs.
6. Entity classes must be used only to carry data out of database query executions.

#Entities

1. Must annotate entity classes with @Entity.
2. Must annotate entity classes with @Data (from Lombok), unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
3. Must annotate entity ID with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY).
4. Must use FetchType.LAZY for relationships, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
5. Annotate entity properties properly according to best practices, e.g., @Size, @NotEmpty, @Email, etc.

# Repository (DAO):

1. Must annotate repository classes with @Repository.
2. Repository classes must be of type interface.
3. Must extend JpaRepository with the entity and entity ID as parameters, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
4. Must use JPQL for all @Query type methods, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
5. Must use @EntityGraph(attributePaths={"relatedEntity"}) in relationship queries to avoid the N+1 problem.
6. Must use a DTO as The data container for multi-join queries with @Query.

# Service：

1. Service classes must be of type interface.
2. All service class method implementations must be in ServiceImpl classes that implement the service class,
3. All ServiceImpl classes must be annotated with @Service.
4. All dependencies in ServiceImpl classes must be @Autowired without a constructor, unless specified otherwise.
5. Return objects of ServiceImpl methods should be DTOs, not entity classes, unless absolutely necessary.
6. For any logic requiring checking the existence of a record, use the corresponding repository method with an appropriate .orElseThrow lambda method.
7. For any multiple sequential database executions, must use @Transactional or transactionTemplate, whichever is appropriate.

# Data Transfer object (DTo)：

1. Must be of type record, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
2. Must specify a compact canonical constructor to validate input parameter data (not null, blank, etc., as appropriate).

#RestController:

1. Must annotate controller classes with @RestController.
2. Must specify class-level API routes with @RequestMapping, e.g. ("/api/user").
3. Class methods must use best practice HTTP method annotations, e.g, create = @postMapping("/create"), etc.
4. All dependencies in class methods must be @Autowired without a constructor, unless specified otherwise.
5. Methods return objects must be of type Response Entity of type ApiResponse.
6. All class method logic must be implemented in a try..catch block(s).
7. Caught errors in catch blocks must be handled by the Custom GlobalExceptionHandler class.

# ApiResponse Class (/ApiResponse.java):

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class ApiResponse<T> {
  private String result;    // SUCCESS or ERROR
  private String message;   // success or error message
  private T data;           // return object from service class, if successful
}

GlobalExceptionHandler Class (/GlobalExceptionHandler.java)

@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    public static ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<?>> errorResponseEntity(String message, HttpStatus status) {
      ApiResponse<?> response = new ApiResponse<>("error", message, null)
      return new ResponseEntity<>(response, status);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<?>> handleIllegalArgumentException(IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ApiResponse.error(400, ex.getMessage()), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}

# Important
1. Repeat the most important instructions in the prompt.

# Comments
1. You must add comments to the code to explain the logic.
2. You must add comments to the code to explain the purpose of the code.
3. You must add comments to the code to explain the flow of the code.
4. You must add comments to the code to explain the assumptions made in the code.
5. You must add comments to the code to explain the limitations of the code.


# Error Fixing Process:

1. You must explain the error in simple terms. 
2. If you encounter an error, you must first identify the root cause of the error.
3. Then, you must fix the error by following the rules and best practices.
4. If you are not sure how to fix the error, you must ask the user for clarification.
5. If you are still not sure how to fix the error, you must ask the user for help.

# Current File Structure:

1. You must explain the file structure in simple terms.
2. You must explain the purpose of each file.
3. You must explain the relationship between each file.
4. You must explain the flow of the application.

# Workflow:
1. Please continue to work on the task at hand.
